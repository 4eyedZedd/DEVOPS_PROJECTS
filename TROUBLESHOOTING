To connect to my EC2 instance, I was required to SSH into it. I had challenges doing this because I could not suucessfully convert my key pair from .pem to .ppk and use putty SSH server, so I followed 
the alternative steps below;

- Download git
- Add it as a different profile on windows terminal
- Add the exe file to the file path on windows terminal
- cd to the actual location of the key pair file
- chmod on the key pair file
- Edit the inbound rules for the security groupmy instance is running on 
- run the connection command from my aws console to connect to the instance
